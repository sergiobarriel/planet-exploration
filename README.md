### :page_with_curl: Instructions
A Rover has just landed on Mars and you, as Mission Control Officer, must control it.

You can find water when rock has been drilled, but in some strange cases you can find on rocks natural deposits of Plutonium-238 radioactive isotopes (!!) that will recharge the Rover

In the terminal, you can throw his commands:
- **A**, to advance
- **B**, to back
- **R**, to turn right
- **L**, to turn left
- **D**, to drill a rock

All Rover movements consume energy. Be careful because you must fulfill the mission.
